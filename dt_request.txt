We have an application (tlo-python-app1) running in the Konvoy General Cluster (tlo-python namespace). Despite our efforts to integrate, we're unable to fully ingest all telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces) into Dynatrace:

Logs: Seem to be ingested, but querying them results in a "permission denied" error.
Metrics: Tried enabling Prometheus metrics collection, but no data is available in Dynatrace.
Traces: Used the OneAgent SDK (Autoinstrumentator), but no trace data is appearing.
Request:
Please provide clear steps or guidance on how to correctly ingest all telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) from this application into Dynatrace.

Let us know if specific configurations or changes are required on our side.
